            <h5>IP address</h5>
            <p>
                An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a
                computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main
                functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the
                growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using
                128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the
                mid-2000s.
            </p>
            <p>
                IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1 in IPv4, and
                2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in CIDR
                notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., 192.168.1.15/24, which is
                equivalent to the historically used subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and by five
                regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to local
                Internet registries, such as Internet service providers (ISPs), and other end users. IPv4 addresses
                were distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each, but have
                been exhausted at the IANA level since 2011. Only one of the RIRs still has a supply for local
                assignments in Africa. Some IPv4 addresses are reserved for private networks and are not globally
                unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Network administrators assign an IP address to each device connected to a network. Such assignments may
                be on a static (fixed or permanent) or dynamic basis, depending on network practices and software
                features.

            <h5>Packets and Routing</h5>
            <p>
                In telecommunications and computer networking, a network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by
                a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data; the latter is
                also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source
                and destination network addresses, error detection codes, or sequencing information). Typically,
                control information is found in packet headers and trailers.
                In packet switching, the bandwidth of the transmission medium is shared between multiple
                communication sessions, in contrast to circuit switching, in which circuits are preallocated for
                the duration of one session and data is typically transmitted as a continuous bit stream.
            </p>
            <p>
                Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple
                networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks,
                such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and computer networks, such as the Internet.
                In packet switching networks, routing is the higher-level decision making that directs network packets
                from their source toward their destination through intermediate network nodes by specific packet
                forwarding mechanisms. Packet forwarding is the transit of network packets from one network interface
                to another. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, gateways,
                firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers also forward packets and perform routing, although
                they have no specially optimized hardware for the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables. Routing tables maintain
                a record of the routes to various network destinations. Routing tables may be specified by an
                administrator, learned by observing network traffic or built with the assistance of routing protocols.

            <h4>Example of routing</h4>
            <p>
                For example: we have a simple network of two computers and a router. Host A wants to communicate with
                Host B. Because hosts are on different subnets, Host A sends its packet to the default gateway (the
                router). The router receives the packet, examines the destination IP address, and looks up into its
                routing table to figure out which interface the packet will be sent. It then sends the packet to Host B.

            <h2>Why we use them</h2>
            <p>
                Because we always need to find the resource server in the complex network, and the IP address is the
                best way for us to locate our target and visit it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because we need to send and receive data through the data, and a packet as the container for the data
                could help us organize it more convenient and efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Routing is one of the most importing steps when sending the packet because we need to determine the path
                 which the packet while be sent through. And routing could help us determine the nodes in this path.
