            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <h5>Domain Name</h5>
            <p>
                A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority
                or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for
                application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network
                domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to
                access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service
                communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name
                registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains)
                of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level
                domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com,
                info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level
                domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically
                open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create
                other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell
                their services to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in
                the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote
                the top of the DNS tree. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be
                written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase
                in technical contexts.

            <h5>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</h5>
            <p>
                The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is an American multi-stakeholder group and
                nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several
                databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's
                stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central
                Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers
                Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between
                ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States
                Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global
                multistakeholder community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of its work has concerned the Internet's global Domain Name System (DNS), including policy
                development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic top-level
                domains (TLDs), and the operation of root name servers. The numbering facilities ICANN manages
                include the Internet Protocol address spaces for IPv4 and IPv6, and assignment of address blocks
                to regional Internet registries. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.
                ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational
                stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global
                Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up,
                consensus-based processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                ICANN's creation was announced publicly on September 17, 1998, and it formally came into being on
                September 30, 1998, incorporated in the U.S. state of California. Originally headquartered in Marina
                del Rey in the same building as the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute
                (ISI), its offices are now in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles in Facebook's old office.

            <h4>Here is an example of ICANN's work:</h4>
            <P>
                One task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for
                generic top-level domains (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation
                with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the
                Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for
                rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system
                for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name
                isputes. According to ICANN policy, domain registrants must agree to be bound by the UDRP —- they cannot
                get a domain name without agreeing to this.
            </P>
            <p>
                Examination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some to conclude that compulsory domain name
                arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the
                First Amendment and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.

            <h2>Why we use them</h2>
            <p>
                Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a
                text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols.
            </p>
            <p>
                An important function of domain names is to provide easily recognizable and memorizable names to
                numerically addressed Internet resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Domain names are also used as simple identification labels to indicate ownership or control of a
                resource.
