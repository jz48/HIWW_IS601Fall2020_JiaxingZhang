            <h5>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h5>
            <p>
                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative,
                hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web,
                where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for
                example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
                Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. Development of early HTTP
                Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
                and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
            </p>
            <h5>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</h5>
            <p>
                Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
                It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.
                In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly,
                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP
                over SSL.
                The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the
                privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle
                attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the
                communications against eavesdropping and tampering. In practice, this provides a reasonable
                assurance that one is communicating with the intended website without interference from attackers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital
                certificates. This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS
                connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate
                information systems on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation
                with the support of web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent. HTTPS is now
                used more often by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity
                on all types of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing
                private.

            <h4>
                Here is the example of the HTTP:
            </h4>
            <p>
                HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997. That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in
                1999, which was likewise replaced by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
                HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", and was published in 2015; it
                is now supported by virtually all web browsers and major web servers over Transport Layer Security
                (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[3] where TLS 1.2 or newer is
                required.
                HTTP/3 is the proposed successor to HTTP/2, which is already in use on the web, using UDP instead
                of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions
                of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome in September 2019,
                and can be enabled in the stable versions of Chrome and Firefox.

                It because of that HTTP is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative,
                hypermedia information systems, which could help users easily access the hypertext documents include
                hyperlinks to other resources, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because as an extension of the HTTP, in HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport
                Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with higher security.
