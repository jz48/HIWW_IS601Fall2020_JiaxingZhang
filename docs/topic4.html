            <h5>Domain Name System</h5>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services,
                or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information
                with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more
                readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying
                computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide,
                distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the
                functionality of the Internet since 1985.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names
                to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators
                may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This
                mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large
                central database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at
                its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data
                communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <h4>
                Here is a example of the how DNS works:
            </h4>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">1. A user types ‘example.com’ into a web browser and the query travels
                    into the Internet and is received by a DNS recursive resolver.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">2. The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver (.).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">3. The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a
                    Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such as .com or .net), which stores the information for
                    its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is pointed toward the .com TLD.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain’s
                    nameserver, example.com.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain’s
                    nameserver.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">7. The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from
                    the nameserver.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address
                    of the domain requested initially.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">9. Once the 8 steps of the DNS lookup have returned the IP address for
                    example.com, the browser is able to make the request for the web page:
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">10. The browser makes a HTTP request to the IP address.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">11. The server at that IP returns the webpage to be rendered in the
                    browser (step 10).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3">

            <h2>Why we use them</h2>
            <p>
                As human beings, we find it much easier to remember names over numbers. When you want to call
                your friend, you’d normally think of their name, search for it in your contact list, and voilá!
                Unless of course you’re some sort of mathematical genius and have a photographic memory…
            </p>
            <p>
                The DNS, or Domain Name System, works in the exact same way. It is essentially a smartphone’s
                contact list of domain names. (Yes, we could use the analogy of  a phone book but hey, it’s the
                21st century!) The DNS contains a website’s numerical IP address and translates it into its
                corresponding domain name. Imagine having to remember the intricate IP address numbers of all
                your favorite websites…
            </p>
            <p>
                The domain is your contact’s name and the IP address is their phone number.
                The DNS is able to retrieve a website and display it in a user’s browser. Every single website
                or domain name has an IP address, which displays its accurate location on the internet. And the
                DNS is the medium to that!
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why it’s crucial that website owners are aware of what the DNS is, how it works, and how it
                can be put to good use. And today, we’ll cover just that!
