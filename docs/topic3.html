            <h5>Domain Name System</h5>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services,
                or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information
                with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more
                readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying
                computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide,
                distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the
                functionality of the Internet since 1985.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names
                to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators
                may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This
                mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large
                central database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at
                its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data
                communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.

                <h4>Here is an example of ICANN's work:</h4>
                <P>
                    One task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for
                    generic top-level domains (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation
                    with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the
                    Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for
                    rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system
                    for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name
                    isputes. According to ICANN policy, domain registrants must agree to be bound by the UDRP â€”- they cannot
                    get a domain name without agreeing to this.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Examination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some to conclude that compulsory domain name
                    arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the
                    First Amendment and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.

                <h2>Why we use them</h2>
                <p>
                    Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a
                    text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important function of domain names is to provide easily recognizable and memorizable names to
                    numerically addressed Internet resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domain names are also used as simple identification labels to indicate ownership or control of a
                    resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational
                    stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global
                    Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up,
                    consensus-based processes.
